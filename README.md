# stFX-vault

The stake FX Liquid Staking Protocol allows their users to earn staking rewards on the FunctionX chain without locking FX or maintaining staking infrastructure.

Users can deposit FX to the Baklava smart contract and receive stFX tokens in return. The smart contract then stakes tokens with the governance-picked node validators. Users' deposited funds are delegated by the smart contract, node validators never have direct access to the users' assets.

The stFX token is free from the limitations associated with a lack of liquidity and can be transferred at any time. The stFX token balance corresponds to the amount that the holder could request to withdraw.
